On Friday 25.9.2020, EA Helsinki participated in HYY's Fresher Challenge. In the Fresher Challenge freshmen get to know the various student organizations by completing fun challenges as a team.

Thanks to all the freshmen who completed our checkpoint! They we're all nice and energetic, and approached our checkpoint thoughtfully.

Our checkpoint consisted of a quiz, where correct answers earned the team money that they then got to give away at the end of the checkpoint. They got to choose their donation target from three effective charities in different cause areas: [The Against Malaria Foundation](https://www.againstmalaria.com/), recommended by [GiveWell](https://www.givewell.org/), [Anima International](https://animainternational.org/), recommended by [Animal Charity Evaluators](https://animalcharityevaluators.org/), and the [Coalition for Rainforest Nations](https://www.rainforestcoalition.org/), recommended by [Founder's Pledge](https://founderspledge.com/stories/climate-change-executive-summary).

The checkpoint was completed by 27 teams, with a total 405€ donated!

The split was €45 for the Against Malaria Foundation, 20€ for Anima International, and a whopping €320 for the Coalition for Rainforest Nations!

Clearly a lot people would be interested in reading more about climate change! We chose The Coalition for Rainforest Nations based on [Founder's Pledge's Climate Change Cause Area Report](https://founderspledge.com/stories/climate-change-executive-summary), which is worth reading.
